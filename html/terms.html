				Nevertheless, Samsung's long-standing company policy does not allow it to accept or consider creative ideas, show designs, photographs, drawings, or original artwork, suggestions for new products or product improvements, suggestions for technologies, methods, techniques, processes, inventions, marketing plans, or any materials other than those it has specifically requested (see below) (“Unsolicited Submissions”). We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by Samsung's or its affiliates' professional staff might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Accordingly, we ask that you do not send us any unsolicited submissions.</p>
				
				<p>Both solicited and unsolicited submissions (collectively “Submissions”) will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary in each instance. For purposes of this paragraph, all community content shall be deemed included in the definition of submissions.

By making a Submission to any Samsung Service or Samsung, you represent that such Submission is original with you and does not violate or infringe upon the rights of any third parties, including, without limitation, any intellectual property rights and rights of publicity and/or privacy.</p>
				
				<p>All submissions to a Samsung service and/or Samsung shall be the sole property of Samsung and will not be acknowledged or returned.

				You understand and acknowledge that Samsung has wide access to ideas, stories, designs, and other literary materials, and that new ideas are constantly being submitted to it or being developed by Samsung's own employees. Many ideas or stories may be competitive with, similar or identical to your Submission in theme, idea, plot, format or other respects.
