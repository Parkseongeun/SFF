				<p>Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and our affiliates (“Samsung”, “we”, “us”, “our”) know how important privacy is to our customers, and we strive to be clear about how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. This Privacy Policy explains our information practices.

This includes customer support for such devices, websites, or online applications.</p>
				
				<p> </p>
				
				<p>While this Privacy Policy applies to all our Services, we also have provided certain specific privacy supplements that contain additional information about our practices in connection with particular Services. These supplements apply to your use of the Services they cover.</p>
				
				<p> </p>

				<p> </p>
				
				<p>It also is important that you check back often for updates to the Privacy Policy. If we update the Privacy Policy we will let you know about changes we consider to be material by placing a notice on relevant Services. By accessing or using our Services after we have placed such a notice, you consent to the new practice(s) identified in the update. The most current version of the Privacy Policy will always be available here. You can check the “effective date” posted at the top to see when the Privacy Policy was last updated.</p>

				<div class="s-text-box  "><p><i>Information you provide directly</i></p>

				<p> </p>
				
				<p>• A number of our Services enable users to create accounts or profiles. In connection with these Services, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself to set up the account or profile. For example, you can submit certain information about yourself, such as your name and email address, when you create a Samsung account.</p>
				
				<p>• If you order a product or paid service from us, we may ask for your name, contact information, shipping and billing address(es), and credit card information in order to process your order.</p>
				
				<p>• Upon your request for customer support submitted through Contact Us in our website, we may ask for certain information about yourself including, without limitation, your name, shipping and billing address(es) and contact information, in order to process your request.</p>

				<p><i>Information about your use of the Services</i></p>
				
				<p> </p>
				
				<p>In addition to the information you provide, we may collect information about your use of our Services through software on your device and other means. For example, we may collect:</p>

				<p>• Log information - such as the time and duration of your use of the Service, search query terms you enter through the Services, and any information stored in cookies that we have set on your device.</p>
				
				<p>• Location information - such as your device’s GPS signal or information about nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers that may be transmitted to us when you use certain Services.</p>
				
				<p>• Voice information - such as recordings of your voice that we make (and may store on our servers) when you use voice commands to control a Service. (Note that if we work with a third-party service provider that provides speech-to-text conversion services on our behalf. This provider may receive and store certain voice commands.)</p>
				
				<p>• Other information about your use of the Services, such as the apps you use, the websites you visit, and how you interact with content offered through a Service.</p>
				
				<p> </p>
				
				<p><i>Information from third-party sources</i></p>
				
				<p> </p>
				
				<p>We may receive information about you from publicly and commercially available sources (as permitted by law), which we may combine with other information we receive from or about you.

				<p> </p>
				
				<p>You can choose not to provide us with certain types of information (e.g., information we request during Samsung account registration), but doing so may affect your ability to use some Services.</p>

				<p> </p>
				
				<p>Third Parties that Provide Content, Advertising or Functionality on Our Services</p>
				
				<p> </p>
				
				<p>Some of the content, advertising, and functionality on our Services may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us. For example:</p>
				
				<p> </p>
				
				<p>• We enable you to watch video content provided by content providers;</p>

				<p>• We enable you to share certain materials on the Services with others through social networking services such as Facebook, Twitter, Google +, and LinkedIn.</p>
				
				<p> </p>
				
				
				<p>These third-parties may collect or receive certain information about your use of the Services, including through the use of cookies, beacons, and similar technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected across different websites and online services. Samsung does not control the data collection and use practices of these companies. Some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers choices about whether to receive targeted advertising. Please visit the websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative “<a href="http://networkadvertising.org" target="_blank" title="Network Advertising Initiative : Open in a New Window">http://networkadvertising.org</a>” and Digital Advertising Alliance “<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank" title="Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Program : Open in a New Window">http://www.aboutads.info/</a>” to learn more.</p>

				<div class="s-text-box  "><p>We, as well as certain third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, beacons, and other technologies in certain areas of our Services.</p>
				
				<p> </p>
				
				<p><i>Cookies</i></p>
				
				<p> </p>
				
				<p>Cookies are small files that store information on your computer, TV, mobile phone or other device. They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize you across different websites, services, devices, and/or browsing sessions. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:</p>
				
				<p> </p>
				
				<p>• Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you don’t have to enter those credentials each time you log on to a service.</p>
				
				<p>• Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they are spending on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt the Services and provide you with a better experience.</p>
				
				<p>• Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don’t receive the same ad each time you access a Service.</p>
				
				<p>•Cookies help us and third parties provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information about your use of our Services and other websites and apps.</p>
				
				<p> </p>
				
				<p>When you use a web browser to access the Services, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. The operating system of your device may contain additional controls for cookies.</p>
				
				<p> </p>
				
				<p>Please note, however, that some Services may be designed to work using cookies and that disabling cookies may affect your ability to use those Services, or certain parts of them.</p>
				
				<p> </p>
				
				<p><i>Other Local Storage</i></p>
				
				<p> </p>
				
				
				<p>We, along with certain third parties, may use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies, pleaseclick here “<a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html" target="_blank" title="Manage, disable Local Shared Objects in Flash Player : Open in a New Window">http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html</a>”.</p>
				
				<p> </p>
				
				<p><i>Beacons</i></p>
				
				<p> </p>
				
				<p>We, along with certain third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or “pixels”) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We and certain third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.</p>
				
				<p> </p>
				
				<p><b><u>By accessing and using our Services, you consent to the storage of cookies, other local storage technologies, beacons and other information on your devices.
